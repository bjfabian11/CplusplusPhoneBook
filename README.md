# CplusplusPhoneBook
A 10 person phone book application I created with C++

Application uses a switch as the menu. Press 0-6 to go to each option.
You have to enter in 10 names and numbers.
From there you can sort ascending or descending but then must print the data to view it.
You can also search for a name and it will display the name and number or tell you it was not found.
Press 6 to end the program.
